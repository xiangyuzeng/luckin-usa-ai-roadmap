## Key Findings

### 1. Opening Week Effect Magnitude

**Overall:** Opening week traffic is **33-36% higher** than the store's subsequent weekly average (same day of week).

**By Store Size (Opening Week Cups):**
- **High-volume stores** (700+ cups): 1.12x - 2.19x (12% - 119% higher)
  - 28th & 6th: 119% higher ⭐
  - 8th & Broadway: 12% higher
- **Medium-volume stores** (300-600 cups): 1.03x - 1.54x (3% - 54% higher)
  - 54th & 8th: 54% higher ⭐
  - 102 Fulton: 38% higher
  - 100 Maiden Ln: 34% higher
  - 37th & Broadway: 6% higher
- **Lower-volume stores** (100-400 cups): 0.93x - 1.03x (-7% - 3%)
  - 221 Grand: 7% LOWER ❌ (outlier)
  - 15th & 3rd: 3% higher

**Key Insight:** The opening week "boost" is strongest for stores that maintain higher baseline traffic (500+ cups), suggesting successful launches amplify sustained performance.

### 2. Post-Opening Traffic Trends

**Declining Trend (5 stores - 63%):**
- **28th & 6th:** Opened at 820 → declined to 200s-300s (70% drop)
- **54th & 8th:** Opened at 477 → declined to 200s-300s (50% drop)
- **102 Fulton:** Opened at 575 → declined to 300s-400s (35% drop)
- **100 Maiden Ln:** Opened at 367 → declined to 200s-270s (40% drop)

**Growing Trend (1 store - 13%):**
- **8th & Broadway:** Opened at 739 → grew to 800s-900s by weeks 10-14 (+30% growth) ⭐
  - Only store showing sustained growth after opening
  - Suggests strong location/product-market fit

**Stable Trend (2 stores - 25%):**
- **37th & Broadway:** 526 → stable around 470-540 (holiday volatility)
- **15th & 3rd:** 143 → stable around 130-150

**Conclusion:** **63% of stores show declining traffic after opening**, suggesting most benefit from a temporary "novelty effect" that fades over 4-8 weeks.

### 3. Day of Week Patterns

**Monday Openings (4 stores):**
- Average opening week ratio: **1.32x** (32% higher)
- Range: 0.93x to 2.19x
- 3 out of 4 had opening week >20% above average
- **Observation:** Monday openings show high variance - can be extremely successful (28th & 6th at 2.19x) or below average (221 Grand at 0.93x)

**Thursday Openings (2 stores):**
- Average opening week ratio: **1.22x** (22% higher)
- Both stores showed opening week advantage (6% and 38%)
- **Observation:** Moderate, consistent opening boost

**Sunday Openings (2 stores):**
- Average opening week ratio: **1.29x** (29% higher)
- Range: 1.03x to 1.54x
- **Observation:** Sunday openings varied widely - 54th & 8th had strong launch (1.54x), 15th & 3rd was minimal (1.03x)

**Tuesday Opening (1 store):**
- **100 Maiden Ln:** 1.34x (34% higher)

**Friday Openings (1 store with sufficient data):**
- **NJ Test Kitchen:** Excluded (test location with minimal traffic)
- **21st & 3rd:** Only 1 week of data (opened 2026-02-06), insufficient for analysis

## Practical Implications

### For Operations Team

1. **Budget for Decline:** Expect 30-50% traffic drop within 2 months after opening for most stores
2. **Opening Week Staffing:** Staff 30-50% above projected steady-state levels for opening week
3. **Marketing Duration:** Opening promotions/buzz drive traffic for 4-8 weeks; plan post-launch campaigns
4. **Inventory Planning:** Stock 30-40% more supplies for opening week, then adjust to normalized levels

### For New Store Planning

**Best Practices (Based on 8th & Broadway Success):**
- Location quality matters more than opening day boost
- Stores that sustain traffic after opening show different characteristics:
  - **8th & Broadway:** High foot traffic area, grew +30% from week 0 to week 14
  - **28th & 6th:** Also high opening (820), but declined -70% → suggests unsustainable launch promotion

**Warning Signs:**
- **221 Grand:** Only store with opening week below average → May indicate poor location/timing
- **28th & 6th:** Extreme opening boost (2.19x) but severe decline → Over-promotion can create unrealistic expectations

---

## Outliers & Special Cases

### Outlier #1: 28th & 6th (Extreme Opening Boost)
- **Ratio:** 2.19x (119% higher than average)
- **Pattern:** Opened at 820 cups, declined to 200s-300s
- **Hypothesis:** Aggressive opening promotion/discounting not sustained
- **Lesson:** High opening traffic doesn't guarantee sustained performance

### Outlier #2: 221 Grand (Below-Average Opening)
- **Ratio:** 0.93x (7% lower than average)
- **Pattern:** Opened at 346, average subsequent weeks 373
- **Hypothesis:** Soft launch, less promotional activity, or opened during holiday season (Dec 15)
- **Lesson:** December openings may face holiday distraction

### Success Story: 8th & Broadway (Sustained Growth)
- **Ratio:** 1.12x opening week (modest)
- **Pattern:** Grew from 739 → 959 by week 14
- **Hypothesis:** Strong location, word-of-mouth growth, effective post-opening marketing
- **Lesson:** Moderate opening + sustained growth > Extreme opening + decline

## Recommendations

### For Future Store Openings

1. **Set Realistic Expectations:**
   - Opening week traffic will likely be 30-40% above steady state
   - Plan for traffic normalization within 4-8 weeks

2. **Balance Opening Promotion:**
   - Avoid over-promotion that creates unsustainable traffic (see 28th & 6th)
   - Focus on building repeat customers, not one-time visitors

3. **Monitor Week 4-8 Performance:**
   - Critical period where "novelty effect" fades
   - True location performance emerges after this period

4. **Weekday Selection:**
   - No significant advantage to specific weekdays
   - Choose based on staffing/logistics rather than traffic optimization

5. **Avoid December Openings:**
   - 221 Grand data suggests holiday season may dilute opening impact
   - September-October appears optimal (see 100 Maiden Ln, 102 Fulton success)

### For Store Performance Evaluation

**Do NOT judge a store's long-term viability by opening week traffic.**

- **Good indicators:** Weeks 8-12 performance, growth trajectory after week 4
- **Bad indicators:** Opening week absolute numbers, week 1-2 traffic

**Example:**
- **8th & Broadway:** Moderate opening (739), strong growth to 900+ → GOOD
- **28th & 6th:** Extreme opening (820), collapsed to 200s → CONCERNING
