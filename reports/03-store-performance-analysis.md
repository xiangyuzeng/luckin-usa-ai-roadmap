## 1. Executive Summary

Luckin Coffee USA has completed eight months of commercial operations since its June 2025 launch, scaling from 2 stores to a portfolio of 12 locations (10 active customer-facing stores, 1 airport kiosk, and 1 NJ test kitchen). This report provides a comprehensive analysis of store-level performance, customer acquisition patterns, maturity curves, and strategic recommendations for the next phase of expansion.

### Key Findings

**Portfolio-Level Metrics (January 2026):**
- Total monthly revenue across all stores: **$362,698**
- Total monthly orders: **73,354**
- Weighted average order value (AOV): **$4.94**
- Average revenue per active store: **$36,270/month** (excluding JFK)
- Production time: **204.3 seconds** average (36% improvement since launch)

**Critical Insights:**

1. **221 Grand Street (Chinatown/Little Italy) is the breakout star.** This store achieved the fastest ramp-up of any location, becoming the highest-revenue store in the portfolio by its second full month of operation (January 2026, $61,283). It surpassed the flagship within 60 days of opening and validates the strategy of targeting high-density Asian-American neighborhoods.

2. **The flagship at 8th & Broadway is in managed decline.** Revenue has fallen 51% from its October 2025 peak of $106,397 to a projected February run-rate of approximately $49,740 (annualized from the partial month). This is a direct consequence of network cannibalization as new stores opened across Manhattan, pulling customers to more convenient locations. This is expected and healthy for the network.

3. **Cannibalization is real but net-positive.** While individual legacy store revenues have declined, total network revenue has grown from $151,742 (July 2025, 2 stores) to $362,698 (January 2026, 11 stores). The network is generating 2.4x more revenue despite individual store declines, confirming that new stores are capturing incremental demand, not just redistributing it.

4. **Midtown commands premium pricing.** The 54th & 8th location consistently delivers the highest AOV in the portfolio ($5.25-$5.68), approximately 15-20% above the network average. This validates the pricing power of office-district locations with higher-income customer bases.

5. **Operational efficiency continues to improve.** Average production time has decreased from 320.3 seconds (July 2025) to 204.3 seconds (January 2026), a 36.2% improvement. This is driven by barista experience curves, process refinements, and equipment standardization across the fleet of 216 IoT devices.

6. **Delivery is a high-value but low-volume channel.** Delivery orders represent only ~1.7% of total orders but ~6.5% of revenue, with delivery AOV of $18-21 compared to pickup AOV of $4-5. This 4x multiplier suggests significant upside in expanding delivery capabilities.

## 3. Individual Store Deep Dives

### 3.1 8th & Broadway (Flagship Store)

**Location:** SoHo / NoLita border
**Opened:** June 2025
**Role:** Brand flagship, highest initial visibility

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Unique Customers | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|------------------|-------|
| Jul 2025 | $76,918 | 19,725 | $3.90 | 12,671 | Launch month, heavy promo |
| Aug 2025 | $86,661 | 20,093 | $4.31 | ~11,500 | Growth phase |
| Sep 2025 | $101,169 | 22,622 | $4.47 | ~10,800 | Strong momentum |
| Oct 2025 | **$106,397** | **23,048** | $4.62 | ~10,200 | **PEAK REVENUE** |
| Nov 2025 | $86,101 | 18,974 | $4.54 | ~8,900 | Decline begins |
| Dec 2025 | $68,543 | 14,152 | $4.84 | ~7,400 | Holiday + cannibalization |
| Jan 2026 | $51,837 | 11,156 | $4.65 | 5,949 | Continued decline |
| Feb 2026(p) | $33,160 | 7,129 | $4.65 | ~4,200 | Projected partial month |

**Analysis:**

The flagship tells a textbook story of a pioneering store in a rapidly expanding network. It peaked at $106,397 in October 2025 -- the highest single-store monthly revenue in the portfolio's history -- then entered a steady decline as five new stores opened within a 2-mile radius between November and February.

The decline in revenue (51% from peak) is almost entirely driven by customer migration, not dissatisfaction. The AOV has actually *increased* from $3.90 at launch to $4.65 in January, indicating that remaining customers are purchasing higher-value items or that the promotional pricing phase has ended. Unique customers dropped from 12,671 to 5,949, a 53% decline that closely mirrors the revenue decline, confirming that volume loss is the primary driver.

**Projection:** This store will likely stabilize in the $40,000-$50,000/month range once network expansion in the immediate vicinity slows. It retains strong brand value as the flagship and benefits from consistent SoHo tourist foot traffic.

### 3.2 28th & 6th (NoHo/Flatiron)

**Location:** Flatiron District / NoHo border
**Opened:** June 2025
**Role:** Second launch store, office neighborhood

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Jul 2025 | $74,824 | 18,509 | $4.04 | Launch month |
| Aug 2025 | **$81,651** | **18,109** | $4.51 | **PEAK REVENUE** |
| Sep 2025 | $68,153 | 13,182 | $5.17 | Decline begins |
| Oct 2025 | $63,226 | 12,522 | $5.05 | Continued decline |
| Nov 2025 | $55,070 | 11,193 | $4.92 | Further erosion |
| Dec 2025 | $41,058 | 7,882 | $5.21 | Holiday + cannibalization |
| Jan 2026 | $35,746 | 6,888 | $5.19 | Stabilizing? |

**Analysis:**

The 28th & 6th store peaked earlier than the flagship (August vs. October), likely because it sits in a more concentrated office area where customer acquisition saturated faster. The decline from peak is 56%, steeper than the flagship, suggesting this location faces greater competitive pressure from surrounding store openings.

A notable positive signal is the AOV trend: it has climbed from $4.04 to $5.19 (a 28.5% increase), the strongest AOV improvement in the portfolio. This suggests that casual or promotional-driven customers have migrated to newer, closer stores while loyal, higher-spending customers remain. The store is becoming a "locals' shop" serving committed repeat customers.

**Projection:** Likely to stabilize around $30,000-$35,000/month. The improving AOV partially offsets volume loss.

### 3.3 102 Fulton Street (Financial District)

**Location:** Financial District, near Fulton Street transit hub
**Opened:** August 2025 (mid-month)

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Aug 2025 | $7,766 | 1,950 | $3.98 | Partial month |
| Sep 2025 | $59,258 | 12,934 | $4.58 | First full month |
| Oct 2025 | **$64,573** | **13,421** | $4.81 | **PEAK** |
| Nov 2025 | $52,377 | 11,140 | $4.70 | Seasonal + Maiden Ln overlap |
| Dec 2025 | $50,044 | 9,603 | $5.21 | Holiday dip |
| Jan 2026 | $43,805 | 8,560 | $5.12 | Steady |

**Analysis:**

102 Fulton is the steady performer of the portfolio. After a rapid ramp from mid-August opening to a September first-full-month of nearly $60K, it peaked at $64,573 in October and has declined more gradually than the original stores (32% from peak vs. 51-56% for the Wave 1 stores). This is because the Financial District has high weekday density and limited nearby Luckin alternatives. The opening of 100 Maiden Lane (0.3 miles away) in September introduced some local cannibalization, but the impact was moderate.

The AOV has improved from $3.98 to $5.12, and the store handles a strong volume of approximately 275 orders per business day. This is a solid workhorse location.

**Projection:** Stable at $40,000-$45,000/month. FiDi demand is predominantly weekday, which creates a natural ceiling but also a reliable floor.

### 3.4 54th & 8th (Midtown West) -- Premium AOV Leader

**Location:** Midtown West, near Columbus Circle and Broadway theaters
**Opened:** August 2025 (mid-month)

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Aug 2025 | $12,728 | 3,149 | $4.04 | Partial month |
| Sep 2025 | $55,764 | 11,087 | $5.03 | First full month |
| Oct 2025 | $63,069 | 12,011 | $5.25 | Strong growth |
| Nov 2025 | $54,107 | 10,555 | $5.13 | Seasonal |
| Dec 2025 | $46,558 | 8,203 | **$5.68** | **Highest AOV in portfolio** |
| Jan 2026 | $42,986 | 7,983 | $5.38 | Stable premium |

**Analysis:**

The Midtown West location at 54th & 8th stands out as the clear AOV leader across the entire portfolio. Its December 2025 AOV of $5.68 is 15% above the network average and 23% above the flagship's launch AOV. This premium pricing power reflects the Midtown office-worker demographic: higher income, less price-sensitive, and more likely to purchase food items or premium beverages alongside standard coffee.

The store has followed a classic maturity curve -- rapid ramp-up, peak at month 3, gradual decline -- but the decline has been moderate (32% from October peak). Midtown's relatively sparse Luckin coverage means less cannibalization pressure than downtown.

The combination of premium AOV and moderate volume decline makes 54th & 8th one of the most valuable stores per-square-foot in the portfolio. It demonstrates that Luckin's product mix can command premium prices in the right location.

**Projection:** Stable at $40,000-$45,000/month with industry-leading AOV metrics.

### 3.5 100 Maiden Lane (FiDi / Insurance District)

**Location:** Financial District, south of Fulton
**Opened:** September 2025

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Sep 2025 | $27,667 | 6,651 | $4.16 | Launch month |
| Oct 2025 | **$40,948** | **8,715** | $4.70 | **PEAK** |
| Nov 2025 | $30,601 | 6,635 | $4.61 | Seasonal decline |
| Dec 2025 | $28,219 | 5,449 | $5.18 | Stable |
| Jan 2026 | $28,226 | 5,581 | $5.06 | Flat month-over-month |

**Analysis:**

100 Maiden Lane is the portfolio's most direct example of intra-network cannibalization. Located just 0.3 miles from 102 Fulton, this store was always going to share a customer base. Its peak revenue of $40,948 is the lowest peak of any store that has had time to mature, and it plateaued early.

However, the store has found a stable floor around $28,000/month with improving AOV ($4.16 to $5.06). The December-to-January flatline at $28,219/$28,226 suggests it has reached steady state. The Insurance District office population provides reliable weekday traffic but limited weekend or evening demand.

When viewed as a network, the two FiDi stores (102 Fulton + 100 Maiden) generated a combined $72,031 in January, which is stronger than any single store's best month except the October flagship peak. The pair effectively blankets the Financial District.

**Projection:** Stable at $25,000-$30,000/month. Not a standalone star, but valuable as part of the FiDi cluster.

### 3.6 221 Grand Street (Chinatown/Little Italy) -- BREAKOUT STAR

**Location:** Chinatown / Little Italy border
**Opened:** December 2025 (mid-month)

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Dec 2025 | $34,753 | 7,394 | $4.70 | Partial month, massive ramp |
| Jan 2026 | **$61,283** | **12,330** | $4.97 | **#1 revenue store in portfolio** |
| Feb 2026(p) | $21,366 | 4,081 | $5.24 | Partial month, projecting $50K+ |

**Analysis:**

221 Grand is the most significant story in Luckin Coffee USA's portfolio. In its first full month of operation, it generated $61,283 in revenue -- becoming the highest-revenue store in the entire network, surpassing the eight-month veteran flagship. No other store has achieved this velocity of ramp-up.

The reasons for this explosive growth are straightforward:

1. **Demographic alignment:** Chinatown has a large Chinese-American population already familiar with the Luckin brand from China. Brand awareness was pre-built, eliminating the typical customer education phase.

2. **Cultural affinity:** The product menu, which includes Chinese-style coffee beverages (coconut lattes, cheese foam drinks, brown sugar flavors), resonates directly with the local palate rather than competing head-to-head with established American coffee chains on their home turf.

3. **Community network effects:** Word-of-mouth in tight-knit ethnic communities spreads faster than traditional marketing. Customers function as organic brand ambassadors.

4. **Underserved market:** Chinatown has historically been underserved by premium coffee chains. Luckin fills a genuine gap rather than fighting for market share in an over-saturated market (like Midtown).

The February partial-month data ($21,366 through ~14 days) projects to approximately $47,000-$52,000 for the full month, with AOV climbing to $5.24. This trajectory suggests sustained demand, not a novelty spike.

**221 Grand validates a critical strategic thesis: Luckin Coffee USA's fastest path to growth is targeting Asian-American communities where the brand already has cultural capital.** This has profound implications for expansion planning (see Section 9).

**Projection:** $55,000-$65,000/month in the near term, with potential to sustain above $50K. This could become the permanent top performer.

### 3.7 37th & Broadway (Garment District / Herald Square)

**Location:** Garment District, near Herald Square and Penn Station
**Opened:** November 2025 (mid-month)

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Nov 2025 | $13,795 | 3,304 | $4.18 | Partial month |
| Dec 2025 | $45,063 | 9,812 | $4.59 | First full month |
| Jan 2026 | $41,852 | 8,873 | $4.72 | Stable |

**Analysis:**

37th & Broadway is a strong performer that benefits from one of Manhattan's highest foot-traffic intersections (Herald Square, Macy's, Penn Station commuter flow). Its first full month at $45,063 places it in the upper tier of store launches, and the January stabilization at $41,852 suggests minimal decline.

The proximity to Penn Station creates an interesting customer mix: regular commuters (who build habits and drive weekday consistency) plus tourists and shoppers (who add weekend volume). This dual-demand profile may protect the store from the sharp weekday-only pattern seen in FiDi locations.

**Projection:** $38,000-$45,000/month. Strong, stable performer.

### 3.8 33rd & 10th (Hudson Yards)

**Location:** Near Hudson Yards development, west side
**Opened:** December 2025

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Dec 2025 | $27,893 | 6,064 | $4.60 | Launch month |
| Jan 2026 | $31,752 | 6,700 | $4.74 | +14% growth |

**Analysis:**

The Hudson Yards store shows healthy month-over-month growth (+14%), which is encouraging for a location in a newer, still-developing neighborhood. The Hudson Yards complex has high foot traffic from office workers, residents, and the Vessel / Edge tourist attractions, but the store's position at 33rd & 10th is slightly west of the main development, which may limit walk-by traffic.

The January revenue of $31,752 from 6,700 orders is solid, and the growing AOV ($4.60 to $4.74) indicates the customer base is stabilizing and trading up.

**Projection:** $30,000-$35,000/month with potential upside as the far West Side continues to develop.

### 3.9 15th & 3rd (Union Square / Gramercy)

**Location:** Union Square East / Gramercy Park area
**Opened:** December 2025 (mid-month)

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Dec 2025 | $11,201 | 2,502 | $4.48 | Partial month |
| Jan 2026 | $25,211 | 5,283 | $4.77 | +125% growth (full month) |

**Analysis:**

15th & 3rd is still in its early ramp-up phase. The jump from $11,201 (partial December) to $25,211 (full January) represents strong acceleration, and the AOV trajectory ($4.48 to $4.77) is healthy. The Union Square area provides a mix of NYU student traffic, office workers, and residential customers.

With the 21st & 3rd store opening in February just 6 blocks north, there is a risk of early cannibalization. The two stores together will form a Gramercy/Union Square cluster that should be monitored closely.

**Projection:** $28,000-$35,000/month at maturity, though the nearby 21st & 3rd opening adds uncertainty.

### 3.10 JFK Terminal 4 (Airport)

**Location:** JFK International Airport, Terminal 4
**Opened:** December 2025

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Dec 2025 | $1,186 | 350 | $3.39 | Only data point |

**Analysis:**

The JFK location is a fundamentally different model from the Manhattan stores. With only 350 orders and $1,186 in revenue for December, it represents the lowest volume and lowest AOV ($3.39) in the portfolio. The low AOV is notable -- airport locations typically command *premium* pricing, so the $3.39 figure suggests heavy promotional activity or a limited menu.

Airport locations serve a strategic purpose beyond revenue: brand visibility to international travelers (especially Chinese nationals who recognize the brand), brand credibility signaling ("we're at JFK"), and a potential testing ground for the airport retail model. However, on pure economics, this location needs significant improvement.

**Projection:** Needs more data. December may not be representative if the store opened late in the month. Target should be $5,000-$10,000/month for an airport kiosk with proper AOV correction.

### 3.11 21st & 3rd (Gramercy) -- Newest Store

**Location:** Gramercy Park area
**Opened:** February 2026

| Month | Revenue | Orders | AOV | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Feb 2026(p) | $8,518 | 1,887 | $4.51 | First days of operation |

**Analysis:**

Too early to draw conclusions. The initial AOV of $4.51 is in line with network averages, and the order volume suggests reasonable initial interest. Located just 6 blocks from 15th & 3rd, this store will need to be monitored for cannibalization effects on its neighbor.

**Projection:** Expect $25,000-$35,000/month at maturity based on comparable stores (15th & 3rd, 33rd & 10th).

## 4. Store Maturity Curve Analysis

### 4.1 Ramp-Up Speed Comparison

A critical metric for retail expansion is how quickly a new store ramps to peak revenue. We measure "months to peak" and "first full month revenue" as proxies:

| Store | First Full Month | First Full Month Rev | Peak Revenue | Months to Peak | Peak Multiple |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| 8th & Broadway | Jul 2025 | $76,918 | $106,397 (Oct) | 4 | 1.38x |
| 28th & 6th | Jul 2025 | $74,824 | $81,651 (Aug) | 2 | 1.09x |
| 102 Fulton | Sep 2025 | $59,258 | $64,573 (Oct) | 2 | 1.09x |
| 54th & 8th | Sep 2025 | $55,764 | $63,069 (Oct) | 2 | 1.13x |
| 100 Maiden Ln | Sep 2025 | $27,667 | $40,948 (Oct) | 2 | 1.48x |
| **221 Grand** | **Jan 2026** | **$61,283** | **$61,283 (Jan)** | **1** | **Still rising** |
| 37th & Broadway | Dec 2025 | $45,063 | $45,063 (Dec) | 1+ | Still rising |
| 33rd & 10th | Dec 2025 | $27,893 | $31,752 (Jan) | 2+ | Still rising |

### 4.2 The Standard Maturity Curve

Based on stores with at least 4 months of data, the typical Luckin Coffee USA store follows this lifecycle:

1. **Month 1 (Launch):** 60-75% of eventual peak revenue. Heavy promotional activity, new-customer acquisition.
2. **Month 2-3 (Growth):** Peak revenue achieved. Word-of-mouth kicks in, repeat customers form habits.
3. **Month 4-6 (Plateau/Early Decline):** Revenue begins declining as promotional customers churn and network cannibalization begins.
4. **Month 7+ (Steady State):** Revenue stabilizes at approximately 40-55% of peak as the store finds its loyal customer base.

**The 221 Grand Exception:** This store broke the standard curve entirely. Its first full month revenue ($61,283) was already higher than the first-full-month performance of every store except the two launch stores. If it follows the standard pattern, its peak could reach $70,000-$80,000 -- which would make it the highest-peaking non-flagship store in the portfolio.

### 4.3 Implied Steady-State Revenue

Based on the maturity curve pattern, we can project steady-state revenues for the portfolio:

| Store | Projected Steady State | Confidence |
|-------|----------------------|------------|
| 8th & Broadway | $42,000-$50,000/mo | High (near steady state) |
| 28th & 6th | $30,000-$35,000/mo | High (near steady state) |
| 102 Fulton | $40,000-$45,000/mo | High |
| 54th & 8th | $40,000-$45,000/mo | High |
| 100 Maiden Ln | $25,000-$30,000/mo | High (already at steady state) |
| 221 Grand | $50,000-$65,000/mo | Medium (still ramping) |
| 37th & Broadway | $38,000-$45,000/mo | Medium |
| 33rd & 10th | $30,000-$35,000/mo | Medium |
| 15th & 3rd | $28,000-$35,000/mo | Low (early stage) |
| 21st & 3rd | $25,000-$35,000/mo | Low (just opened) |
| **Portfolio Total** | **$348,000-$425,000/mo** | Medium |

This implies an annualized run-rate of **$4.2M-$5.1M** at network steady state for the current 10-store (plus JFK) configuration.

## 5. Cannibalization Analysis

### 5.1 Defining Cannibalization

Store cannibalization occurs when a new location draws customers from an existing store rather than capturing purely incremental demand. In Luckin Coffee USA's dense Manhattan network, cannibalization is inevitable and, to some degree, intentional -- the goal is network coverage, not individual store maximization.

### 5.2 Measured Cannibalization Events

**Event 1: Wave 2 Impact on Wave 1 Stores (Aug-Sep 2025)**

When 54th & 8th and 102 Fulton opened in August, the two original stores were still growing. The flagship continued growing through October, suggesting minimal cannibalization from stores located 2+ miles away. The 28th & 6th store, however, peaked in August and began declining in September, possibly influenced by 54th & 8th capturing some northbound customers.

- Estimated cannibalization: 5-10% of 28th & 6th revenue redirected to 54th & 8th.

**Event 2: FiDi Overlap (Sep 2025 onward)**

The opening of 100 Maiden Lane (0.3 miles from 102 Fulton) is the portfolio's clearest cannibalization case. After 100 Maiden opened in September:
- 102 Fulton's revenue declined from $64,573 (Oct peak) to $43,805 (Jan), a 32% drop.
- 100 Maiden peaked at $40,948 then stabilized at $28,226.
- Combined FiDi revenue declined from $105,521 (Oct, both stores combined) to $72,031 (Jan), but remains higher than 102 Fulton alone could have achieved.

- **Net cannibalization estimate:** 100 Maiden Lane captured approximately $15,000/month from 102 Fulton while generating approximately $13,000/month in incremental revenue. The pair is net-positive by approximately $13,000/month over a single-store scenario.

**Event 3: Wave 5 Impact on Flagship (Dec 2025)**

The December opening of four new stores (221 Grand, 33rd & 10th, 15th & 3rd, JFK) coincided with a sharp decline at the flagship:
- 8th & Broadway dropped from $86,101 (Nov) to $68,543 (Dec) to $51,837 (Jan).
- 221 Grand at Chinatown (0.8 miles south) is the most likely cannibalizer, as it draws from the same Lower Manhattan customer pool.

- **Estimated cannibalization:** 221 Grand captured approximately $15,000-$20,000/month from the flagship while generating $40,000+/month in incremental revenue from the Chinatown customer base. Strongly net-positive.

### 5.3 Cannibalization Summary

| Pair | Distance | Overlap Estimate | Net Revenue Impact |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 102 Fulton / 100 Maiden | 0.3 mi | High (30-40%) | +$13K/mo incremental |
| 28th & 6th / 54th & 8th | 1.5 mi | Low (5-10%) | +$35K/mo incremental |
| 8th & Broadway / 221 Grand | 0.8 mi | Medium (15-20%) | +$25K/mo incremental |
| 15th & 3rd / 21st & 3rd | 0.4 mi | TBD (too early) | Monitor closely |

**Key Insight:** Every store opening has been net-positive for the network, even accounting for cannibalization. The total network revenue grew from $151K/month (2 stores) to $363K/month (11 stores), far exceeding what linear scaling of the original stores would have produced. However, the 15th & 3rd / 21st & 3rd pair at 0.4 miles apart warrants close monitoring, as the Gramercy area may not have sufficient density to support two stores at sustainable economics.

## 6. Geographic Strategy Assessment

### 6.1 Manhattan Concentration Map

All 10 active customer-facing stores are located on Manhattan island, creating a dense urban cluster:

```
NORTH
  |
  54th & 8th .............. (Midtown West)
  |
  37th & Broadway ......... (Garment District)
  33rd & 10th ............. (Hudson Yards)
  |
  28th & 6th .............. (Flatiron)
  |
  21st & 3rd .............. (Gramercy) [NEW]
  |
  15th & 3rd .............. (Union Square)
  |
  8th & Broadway .......... (SoHo - FLAGSHIP)
  |
  221 Grand ............... (Chinatown) [STAR]
  |
  102 Fulton .............. (FiDi)
  100 Maiden Ln ........... (FiDi)
  |
SOUTH
```

### 6.2 Coverage Gaps

Despite 10 stores, significant Manhattan neighborhoods remain unserved:

| Gap Area | Population Density | Office Density | Priority |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Upper East Side** (60th-90th, E) | Very High (residential) | Medium | High |
| **Upper West Side** (60th-90th, W) | Very High (residential) | Medium | High |
| **East Village / LES** | High (young, trendy) | Low | Medium |
| **Midtown East** (40th-55th, E) | High | Very High | High |
| **Chelsea** (14th-23rd, W) | High | Medium | Medium |
| **Harlem** | Medium | Low | Low |
| **Washington Heights** | Medium (Dominican community) | Low | Low |

### 6.3 Beyond Manhattan

No stores exist outside Manhattan (except the NJ test kitchen and JFK kiosk). Critical expansion opportunities in the NYC metro area include:

1. **Flushing, Queens:** The largest Chinatown in the NYC area by population. Given the 221 Grand success, Flushing is the single highest-priority expansion target. The Chinese-American population is 3-4x the size of Manhattan's Chinatown, and the brand recognition dynamics that drove 221 Grand's success would amplify.

2. **Sunset Park / 8th Avenue, Brooklyn:** Another significant Chinese-American community, rapidly growing, with strong alignment to Luckin's brand identity.

3. **Downtown Brooklyn / DUMBO:** High office density, growing tech sector, good demographic fit.

4. **Jersey City / Hoboken:** Large commuter populations with Manhattan-comparable incomes. Hudson County has a growing Asian-American population.

## 7. Store Economics

### 7.1 Revenue per Store Analysis

Using January 2026 as the reference month (the most complete month with all 10 stores active):

| Tier | Stores | Revenue Range | Avg Revenue | % of Portfolio |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Tier 1 (Star) | 221 Grand | $61,283 | $61,283 | 17% |
| Tier 2 (Strong) | 8th & Bway, 102 Fulton, 54th & 8th, 37th & Bway | $42,000-$52,000 | $45,120 | 50% |
| Tier 3 (Developing) | 28th & 6th, 33rd & 10th, 100 Maiden, 15th & 3rd | $25,000-$36,000 | $30,234 | 33% |

### 7.2 Implied Unit Economics

While we do not have access to store-level P&L data, we can estimate key economics based on industry benchmarks and known data:

**Revenue assumptions** (January 2026, average store):
- Monthly revenue: $36,270
- Daily revenue: $1,209 (assuming 30 operating days)
- Orders per day: 244
- Revenue per order: $4.94

**Cost assumptions** (industry benchmarks for Manhattan coffee retail):
- Rent: $8,000-$15,000/month (highly variable by location)
- Labor (3-4 baristas per shift, 2 shifts): $18,000-$24,000/month
- COGS (coffee, milk, consumables): 25-30% of revenue = $9,068-$10,881
- Technology & IoT: ~$2,000/month (per infrastructure report estimate of $20K/store/month total)
- Utilities, insurance, misc: $3,000-$5,000/month

**Implied monthly costs:** $40,068-$56,881
**Implied break-even revenue:** $40,000-$57,000/month

This analysis suggests that **Tier 1 and upper Tier 2 stores are likely operating at or near break-even**, while **Tier 3 stores and the JFK location are likely operating at a loss**. The portfolio as a whole is likely cash-flow negative, consistent with an early-stage market expansion strategy that prioritizes market share over immediate profitability.

### 7.3 Delivery Economics

Delivery represents a high-value revenue channel with distinct economics:

| Metric | Delivery | Pickup | Multiple |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| AOV | $18-$21 | $4-$5 | 4.0-4.2x |
| % of Orders | ~1.7% | ~98.3% | -- |
| % of Revenue | ~6.5% | ~93.5% | -- |
| Implied orders/month (network) | ~1,247 | ~72,107 | -- |
| Implied revenue/month (network) | ~$23,575 | ~$339,123 | -- |

The delivery channel's 4x AOV premium reflects bundle ordering (customers ordering multiple drinks or adding food items when delivery fees make single-item orders uneconomical). At ~1,247 orders per month generating ~$23,575, delivery is meaningful but underdeveloped. Increasing delivery share from 1.7% to 5% of orders would add approximately $47,000/month in incremental revenue across the network.

---

## 8. Operational Efficiency

### 8.1 Production Time Trend

Average production time (seconds from order receipt to drink completion):

| Month | Avg Production Time | Month-over-Month Change | Cumulative Improvement |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Jul 2025 | 320.3s (5:20) | -- | Baseline |
| Aug 2025 | 242.9s (4:03) | -24.2% | -24.2% |
| Sep 2025 | 221.1s (3:41) | -9.0% | -31.0% |
| Oct 2025 | 214.3s (3:34) | -3.1% | -33.1% |
| Nov 2025 | 209.5s (3:30) | -2.2% | -34.6% |
| Dec 2025 | 208.3s (3:28) | -0.6% | -35.0% |
| Jan 2026 | 204.3s (3:24) | -1.9% | -36.2% |

The production time curve shows a classic learning curve: dramatic early improvements (24% reduction in month 1) followed by diminishing but continued gains. The current 204.3-second average (3 minutes 24 seconds) is approaching what may be a natural floor given the complexity of Luckin's menu (which includes blended drinks, pour-overs, and multi-step specialty beverages).

**Benchmark comparison:** Industry standard for specialty coffee is 2-4 minutes per drink. Luckin USA at 3:24 is comfortably within range, though Luckin China achieves sub-2-minute averages due to higher automation and simpler menu focus. Closing this gap should be a medium-term operational priority.

### 8.2 IoT Equipment Fleet

The network operates 216 IoT-connected devices across all locations:

| Equipment Category | Units | Online | Offline | Online Rate | Notes |
|-------------------|-------|--------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Handheld Blenders | 51 | 16 | 35 | **31.4%** | Critical concern |
| Coffee Machines (Cameo) | 28 | ~28 | 0 | ~100% | Core equipment |
| Thawing Refrigerators | 26 | 25 | 1 | 96.2% | Good |
| Refrigerators | 17 | ~17 | 0 | ~100% | Good |
| Milk Dispensers | 13 | ~13 | 0 | ~100% | Good |
| IoT Gateways | 12 | ~12 | 0 | ~100% | Network infrastructure |
| Syrup Machines | 11 | ~11 | 0 | ~100% | Good |
| Venus Drip Brewers | 6 | ~6 | 0 | ~100% | Specialty equipment |
| Test / Other Devices | ~52 | Varies | Varies | -- | NJ kitchen + spares |
| **Total** | **216** | **~181** | **~35** | **83.8%** | |

**Critical Finding: Handheld Blender Fleet Health**

The most concerning operational data point is the handheld blender fleet: only 16 of 51 units (31.4%) are online. Handheld blenders are used for Luckin's signature blended drinks (coconut latte, ice-blended beverages), which are among the highest-AOV items on the menu. If 35 blenders are offline, it could mean:

1. **Equipment failure:** Blenders have shorter lifespans than other equipment and may need replacement.
2. **Spare inventory:** Some units may be held as backups at the NJ kitchen.
3. **Seasonal storage:** Some units may be powered down during winter when cold blended drink demand drops.

Regardless of the cause, ensuring sufficient blender capacity will be critical as warmer months approach and blended drink demand increases. A blender shortage during summer 2026 would directly impact revenue through menu limitations and longer production times.

**Recommendation:** Audit all 35 offline blenders. Determine status (broken, spare, stored) and ensure at least 40 units are operational by May 2026 to support summer demand.

### 8.3 Equipment per Store

With 216 devices across 12 locations (including NJ kitchen), the average is approximately 18 devices per location. Assuming the NJ kitchen holds ~30 test/training devices, active stores average approximately 15-16 devices each, which aligns with a standard Luckin store configuration:

- 2-3 Coffee Machines (Cameo)
- 2 Refrigerators (thawing + storage)
- 4-5 Handheld Blenders
- 1 Milk Dispenser
- 1 Syrup Machine
- 1 IoT Gateway
- 1 Venus Drip Brewer (select stores)
- 1-2 Other specialized devices

## 9. Expansion Strategy Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive analysis of store performance, maturity curves, cannibalization patterns, and demographic alignment, we recommend the following expansion strategy:

### 9.1 Highest Priority: Replicate the 221 Grand Model

**Target:** Flushing, Queens (Main Street corridor)
**Rationale:** 221 Grand's breakout success validates the strategy of targeting established Chinese-American communities. Flushing's Chinatown is the largest in the NYC metro area (3-4x Manhattan Chinatown's Chinese-American population), with enormous foot traffic, dense residential and commercial activity, and virtually no premium Chinese coffee brand presence.
**Projected Performance:** $60,000-$80,000/month based on 221 Grand's trajectory scaled for Flushing's larger addressable market.
**Timeline:** Open by Q2 2026 to capture summer demand.

### 9.2 High Priority: Fill Manhattan Gaps

**Target 1: Midtown East (Lexington & 50th or 3rd & 47th)**
**Rationale:** The portfolio's only Midtown store (54th & 8th) commands the highest AOV in the network, proving Midtown's premium pricing power. Midtown East has comparable office density but zero Luckin presence.
**Projected Performance:** $40,000-$50,000/month with premium AOV ($5.00+).

**Target 2: Upper East Side (Lexington & 75th or 3rd & 82nd)**
**Rationale:** Dense residential neighborhood with high average income. Would be the first Luckin store north of 54th Street, expanding the brand's geographic reach significantly.
**Projected Performance:** $30,000-$40,000/month.

### 9.3 Medium Priority: Outer Borough Expansion

**Target 3: Sunset Park, Brooklyn (8th Avenue & 50th Street)**
**Rationale:** Brooklyn's Chinatown, following the 221 Grand playbook. Smaller than Flushing but strong brand-recognition dynamics.
**Projected Performance:** $35,000-$50,000/month.

**Target 4: Downtown Brooklyn (Fulton Mall area)**
**Rationale:** High office density, growing tech sector, transit hub. Would be the first Brooklyn store outside Chinatown, testing the brand in a non-Chinese-American market outside Manhattan.
**Projected Performance:** $30,000-$40,000/month.

### 9.4 Store Opening Cadence Recommendation

Based on the observed cannibalization patterns and operational capacity:

- **Q2 2026:** 2 new stores (Flushing + Midtown East)
- **Q3 2026:** 2 new stores (Upper East Side + Sunset Park)
- **Q4 2026:** 1-2 new stores (Downtown Brooklyn + opportunistic)

This pace of 5-6 new stores per year allows the operations team to maintain quality while building toward a 16-18 store portfolio by year-end 2026.

### 9.5 Stores to Monitor for Potential Closure

While no store currently warrants closure, two locations should be monitored:

1. **JFK T4:** If revenue does not reach $5,000/month by Q2 2026, evaluate whether the strategic brand-visibility value justifies the cost.
2. **100 Maiden Lane:** At $28,226/month and heavily cannibalized by 102 Fulton, this is the weakest Manhattan store. If it drops below $20,000/month, consider whether the FiDi cluster needs both locations.

## Report Methodology & Limitations

**Data Sources:** Store revenue, order counts, and AOV data sourced from internal POS and order management systems (MySQL databases: `luckyus-order`, `luckyus-isales-market`). IoT data from IoT management platform. Production time data from barista workflow tracking system.

**Limitations:**
1. February 2026 data is partial (approximately 14 days) and has been noted as projected where used.
2. Unique customer counts are only available for the flagship store; other stores use order-based proxies.
3. Store-level P&L data (rent, labor, COGS) is not available; unit economics in Section 7 are estimated from industry benchmarks.
4. Delivery data is available only at the network level, not per-store.
5. JFK T4 has limited data (one month) and may not be representative.
6. The NJ Test Kitchen is excluded from all revenue and performance analyses.

**Report Author:** Infrastructure & Analytics Team
**Next Update:** March 2026 (with full February data and Q1 2026 quarterly review)
