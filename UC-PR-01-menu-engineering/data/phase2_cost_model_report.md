**Strategic action**: Maintain quality and visibility. These 14 items generate 60% of total contribution margin.

### Plow Horses (11 items) — Increase Margin
High popularity, but margin below threshold. Need cost optimization or price adjustment.

| Product | COGS | CM$ | CM% | Qty | Key Cost Driver |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|
| Iced Kyoto Matcha Latte | $1.92 | $1.55 | 44.7% | 37,263 | PFM000020 matcha pre-mix (120g) |
| Cold Brew | $1.58 | $1.55 | 49.5% | 19,431 | Cold brew concentrate |
| Coconut Latte (Hot) | $1.80 | $1.50 | 45.5% | 18,738 | Coconut milk ($0.004/ml) |
| Iced Kyoto Matcha Coconut | $2.12 | $1.42 | 40.1% | 18,208 | Matcha pre-mix + coconut milk |
| Sausage Egg Cheese Croissant | $2.56 | $2.42 | 48.6% | 11,790 | Wholesale food cost ($2.50) |
| Pineapple Cold Brew | $2.14 | $0.97 | 31.2% | 10,027 | Multi-ingredient fruit blend |
| Mango Coconut Sunrise | $1.77 | $1.32 | 42.7% | 8,412 | Mango syrup + coconut milk |
| Kyoto Matcha Coconut (Hot) | $2.42 | $1.00 | 29.2% | 7,860 | Coconut milk (390ml) + matcha |
| Iced Toffee Hazelnut Latte | $1.69 | $1.70 | 50.1% | 7,604 | Hazelnut syrup + toffee topping |
| Iced Matcha Latte | $1.49 | $1.63 | 52.2% | 6,941 | Matcha Sweet Blend (33.7g) |

**Strategic action**: These are volume generators. Reduce COGS through portion optimization, supplier negotiation (especially coconut milk and matcha pre-mix), or modest price increases. The Iced Kyoto Matcha Latte alone contributes $57.8K — a small margin improvement has massive impact.

### Puzzles (16 items) — Increase Popularity
Good margins but low sales volume. Could become Stars with better promotion.

| Product | COGS | CM$ | CM% | Qty | Opportunity |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|-------------|
| Iced Spanish Latte | $0.93 | $2.49 | 72.8% | 6,238 | Near Star threshold — promote |

| Hot Chocolate | $0.97 | $2.25 | 69.9% | 2,398 | Winter push opportunity |
| Chocolate Chip Cookies | $1.06 | $1.92 | 64.4% | 2,187 | Low-cost food attach |
| Iced Latte (Flat White) | $0.67 | $2.71 | 80.2% | 1,823 | Rebrand/merge with Iced Latte |
| Iced Flat White | $0.81 | $2.64 | 76.5% | 1,611 | Rebrand/merge with Iced Latte |

**Strategic action**: Prioritize Iced Spanish Latte, Iced Chocolate, and Smoothie for promotion — they have the highest margins. Pumpkin Spice items are seasonal Stars.

### Dogs (17 items) — Re-evaluate
Low popularity AND low margin. Candidates for reformulation, repricing, or discontinuation.

| Product | COGS | CM$ | CM% | Qty | Assessment |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|------------|
| Iced Pistachio Matcha Coconut | $1.85 | $1.57 | 45.9% | 6,350 | Near Plow Horse — monitor |
| Iced Creme Brulee Latte | $1.89 | $1.59 | 45.7% | 5,987 | Close to threshold on both axes |
| Blood Orange Cold Brew | $2.80 | $0.28 | 9.1% | 5,436 | Very low margin — reformulate |
| Raspberry Cold Brew | $2.78 | $0.28 | 9.2% | 5,153 | Very low margin — reformulate |

| Dreamy Strawberry | $1.83 | $1.39 | 43.2% | 3,521 | Moderate — monitor |
| Grapefruit Mango Drink | $2.11 | $0.97 | 31.5% | 3,287 | Low margin, niche appeal |
| Coconut Velvet Latte (Hot) | $1.94 | $1.58 | 44.9% | 3,198 | Close to threshold |
| Kyoto Matcha Smoothie | $3.21 | $0.27 | 7.8% | 2,654 | Very low margin — reformulate |
| Iced Matcha Coconut Water | $2.06 | $1.16 | 36.0% | 2,543 | Niche — keep or discontinue |
| Zen Berry | $1.89 | $1.59 | 45.7% | 2,134 | New item — grow or drop |
| Sunny Citrus | $1.65 | $1.80 | 52.2% | 1,987 | Near Puzzle — improve promotion |
| Iced Pistachio Oat Latte | $1.95 | $1.57 | 44.6% | 1,876 | New item — grow or drop |
| Pistachio Oat Latte (Hot) | $3.57 | -$0.09 | -2.6% | 1,654 | Negative margin — reprice |

**Strategic action**:
- **Immediate repricing needed**: Blood Orange Cold Brew, Raspberry Cold Brew, Kyoto Matcha Smoothie, Pistachio Matcha Coconut (Hot), Pistachio Oat Latte (Hot)
- **Monitor new items**: Pistachio products are new launches — give 3-6 months to build volume before deciding
- **Discontinuation candidates**: Items with both low volume AND single-digit CM% if no strategic purpose

## Cost Model Methodology

### Approach
Since no procurement/pricing data exists in any of the 4 databases, we use a **hybrid model**:

1. **Ingredient quantities**: Extracted from `formula_json` in `opproduction.t_commodity` for all 58 SPUs
2. **Unit prices**: Estimated from US foodservice wholesale market data (2024-2025 pricing)
3. **Revenue**: Actual `pay_money` from `salesorder.t_order_item` (Oct 2024 – Feb 2026)

### Price Sources
- **Coffee beans**: Specialty espresso at $8-12/lb wholesale → $0.018-0.024/g
- **Conventional milk**: $3.50-4.50/gal → ~$0.0012/ml
- **Plant-based milk**: Oat $0.005/ml, Coconut $0.004/ml, Almond $0.0042/ml
- **Syrups**: DaVinci Gourmet at $8-12/750ml → $0.011-0.016/ml
- **Matcha**: Standard blend $0.035/g, Kyoto premium $0.055/g
- **Packaging**: Industry standard pricing ($0.04-0.15/piece)
- **PFM pre-mixes**: Estimated based on usage volumes (see calibration notes below)

### PFM Pre-mix Price Calibration

PFM-prefix codes represent semi-finished/pre-mixed items not found in t_mdm_goods. Initial estimates caused negative margins on popular products, indicating overpriced assumptions. Calibration was performed:

| Code | Identity | Initial | Calibrated | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| PFM000020 | Kyoto Matcha Pre-mix | $0.040/g | $0.012/g | Used at 45-125g/drink; only 0.1g pure matcha added separately — this is a diluted sugar/milk powder/matcha blend |
| PFM000029 | Pistachio Cream/Paste | $0.030/g | $0.012/g | Used at 111.5g/drink — a pistachio-flavored cream base, not pure pistachio paste |
| PFM000005 | Velvet/Thick Milk Base | $0.010/g | $0.006/g | Used at 32-120g/drink — enriched/thickened milk product |

### Key Assumptions & Limitations

1. **Unit prices are estimates** — actual procurement costs will differ. The model should be recalibrated when procurement data becomes available.
2. **No labor, overhead, or occupancy costs** — this model covers ingredient COGS only, not fully-loaded cost per serving.
3. **Standard recipe used** — each SPU has multiple size/customization variants; we use the most common (canonical) variant.
4. **PFM codes are inferred** — identities are based on recipe context, not confirmed from supplier data.
5. **Sales data is cumulative** (Oct 2024 – Feb 2026) — seasonal items may have compressed selling windows.
6. **Revenue uses actual paid price** (`pay_money`), not list price. Average ~48% discount depth.

### Sensitivity Analysis

The model is most sensitive to:
1. **PFM000020 price** (Kyoto Matcha Pre-mix): A $0.005/g change shifts Iced Kyoto Matcha Latte COGS by $0.60/cup, affecting $22K+ in total CM across 37K units
2. **Coconut milk price** (GS07506): $0.001/ml change affects all coconut drinks — ~$0.30/cup across 130K+ units
3. **Discount depth**: At ~48% average, every 1% reduction in discounting adds ~$0.03/unit to CM across 560K units = ~$16.8K

---

## Actionable Recommendations

### Quick Wins (Pricing & Promotion)
1. **Promote Iced Chocolate** (86.5% CM, only 3,156 units) — highest margin item with massive upside
2. **Promote Smoothie** (82.5% CM, 2,876 units) — near-zero COGS at $0.57
3. **Push Iced Spanish Latte** to Star status — at 6,238 units it's close to the 1.21% threshold
4. **Raise prices on Cold Brew variants** (Blood Orange, Raspberry, Green) — all under 10% CM

### Portfolio Optimization
5. **Reduce matcha pre-mix portions** by 5-10% across Kyoto Matcha line — saves $0.06-0.12/cup
6. **Negotiate coconut milk procurement** — it's the #1 cost driver across 6 high-volume products
7. **Bundle food items** with Star beverages — Croissants and Cookies have 55-64% CM
8. **Evaluate Pistachio line pricing** — PR000109 and PR000111 need $0.50-1.00 price increases

### Discount Strategy
9. **Reduce discounting on Star items** — at ~48% discount depth, even 5% reduction adds $84K/year
10. **Shift promotional spend to Puzzle items** — use vouchers on high-margin, low-volume items instead
