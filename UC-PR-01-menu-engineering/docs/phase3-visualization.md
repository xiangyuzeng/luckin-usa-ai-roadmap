## 1. Chart Inventory

| # | File | Chart Type | Description |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `charts/01_bcg_matrix.png` | Scatter (bubble) | BCG matrix — X: sales mix%, Y: CM%, bubble size: total CM$, color: quadrant |
| 2 | `charts/02_category_breakdown.png` | Stacked bar | Revenue and unit breakdown by BCG classification |
| 3 | `charts/03_margin_vs_discount.png` | Scatter | Contribution margin % vs discount depth per product |
| 4 | `charts/04_cm_ranking.png` | Horizontal bar | Top 20 products ranked by total contribution margin ($) |
| 5 | `charts/05_cogs_unit_economics.png` | Grouped bar | COGS per unit vs CM$ per unit for top products |

## 2. BCG Scatter Plot Details

### 2.1 Thresholds

| Threshold | Value | Method |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Popularity (X-axis) | 1.21% | 1/58 × 70% (Kasavana-Smith standard) |
| CM% (Y-axis) | 56.8% | Revenue-weighted: Σ(total_cm) / Σ(total_revenue) × 100 |

> **Note:** The revenue-weighted threshold (56.8%) differs from the simple weighted average (52.5%) used in Phase 2 classification. The scatter plot uses the revenue-weighted version for visual accuracy.

### 2.2 Key Visual Insights

- **Drip Coffee** — Most efficient Star: 82.1% CM%, 7.29% sales mix (high margin, moderate volume)
- **Iced Coconut Latte** — Volume-driven Star: 61.3% CM%, 12.5% sales mix (largest bubble)
- **Cluster of matcha products** in Plow Horse quadrant — high volume but depressed margins due to PFM000020 costs
- **Food items** (croissants, cookies, muffins) scattered across Puzzle quadrant — low volume but healthy margins

## 3. Margin vs Discount Analysis

Strong **negative correlation** between discount depth and contribution margin %:
- Products with >55% discount depth average <40% CM%
- Products with <40% discount depth average >65% CM%
- **Implication:** Reducing discount depth on Stars by 5% could significantly improve margins

### 5.2 Least Cost-Efficient Products

| Product | COGS/Unit | CM$/Unit | CM% |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----|
| Pistachio Oat Latte (Hot) | $3.42 | -$0.09 | -2.6% |
| Blood Orange Cold Brew | $2.18 | $0.22 | 9.1% |
| Iced Pistachio Oat Latte | $2.85 | $0.31 | 9.8% |
